## Playbox

Playbox! is a sandbox-proving-ground for people interested in working with us here at Kalamuna. It's a magnificent and collaborative code-garden where would-be code artists, site builder and designers alike can play around and show what they've got. It's also a place where you can ask questions, collaborate and learn. Think you've got what it takes?

## Your Mission

You've been handed a Drupal 7 project called [Megaman Robots vs US Presidents](http://playbox.kalamuna.com) which was built by another development team. It is a Minimal Lovable Product (MLP). This means that it has all the core functionality it needs to deliver value but it lacks the full suite of features it needs to be face-meltingly awesome. Additionally, the budget was tight at the end of the MLP phase so the code did not go through a rigorous testing or QA process. This means that the code is rife with bugs, fast and easy code, and not tested for mobile/cross browser compatibility.

Your mission, if you choose to accept it is two fold:

*1. Help build out some of the remaining features that are listed here.*
*2. Explore the code, test the site, identify bugs, submit those bugs and then solve them.*

You should timebox about an hour or two but obviously feel free to spend as much time as you want. Focus on the things you want to focus on.

## Getting started
